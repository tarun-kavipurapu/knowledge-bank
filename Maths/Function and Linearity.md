You call something a function y = f(x) when  single x value returns only one y value:
for example: 
$$
y = x^2 \; is \; a \;funciton
$$
$$
y^2=x \; is \; not \; a function 
$$
- This is not a function beacuse for a single x there there might be two different y values.
- this can also be done by geomatrically making a graph and drawing a verticle line if it intersects  the curve more than once  then it is not a function

## Condition of Linearity
We call a function of a real value linear if it satisfies:
	1. Homogeneity
